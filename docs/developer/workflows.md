### **1. Operational Analysis**

- **Identify Operational Scenarios**: Define how users will interact with the app. For example, monitoring changes in MongoDB, processing new entries, and managing files.
- **Use Cases**: Document use cases such as "monitoring new conversations," "extracting code snippets," and "saving file metadata."

### **2. System Need Analysis**

- **System Requirements**: Based on the operational scenarios, identify the key requirements. For example, "The system must handle MongoDB change streams," "The system must extract and save code snippets," etc.
- **Functional Analysis**: Break down these requirements into functional components. Identify functions such as "watch for changes," "process new entries," and "save file metadata."

### **3. Logical Architecture**

- **Logical Components**: Define the logical components required for your app. For instance, "MongoDBWatcher," "CodeSnippetExtractor," and "MetadataManager."
- **Interactions**: Model how these components interact. For example, the **`MongoDBWatcher`** triggers the **`CodeSnippetExtractor`**, which then uses **`MetadataManager`** to save the data.

### **4. Physical Architecture**

- **Physical Components**: Map the logical components to actual implementation classes and modules. For example, the **`MongoDBWatcher`** class, the **`extract_code_snippets`** function, etc.
- **Infrastructure**: Define the physical infrastructure, such as the MongoDB instance, file system for saving snippets, and any external APIs or services.

### **5. Component Design**

- **Detailed Design**: Specify the design of each component. For instance, the **`MongoDBWatcher`** class needs methods for watching changes and registering handlers.
- **Interfaces**: Define the interfaces between components. For example, the format of the data passed from the watcher to the extractor.

### **6. Validation and Verification**

- **Validation**: Ensure the architecture meets the initial requirements. This might include testing the end-to-end flow of monitoring changes and processing entries.
- **Verification**: Verify that each component performs as expected. For instance, ensure that code snippets are correctly extracted and saved, and metadata is accurately recorded.

### **Example: Refining Data Workflow**

### **Step 1: Define Operational Scenarios**

- Monitoring new entries in MongoDB.
- Processing new conversation documents to extract code snippets.
- Saving the extracted snippets and recording metadata.

### **Step 2: Identify Key Requirements**

- The app must handle change streams from MongoDB.
- The app must extract code snippets accurately.
- The app must save snippets to files and record metadata.

### **Step 3: Develop Logical Architecture**

- **Components**:
    - **`MongoDBWatcher`**: Monitors MongoDB for new entries.
    - **`CodeSnippetExtractor`**: Extracts code snippets from conversation content.
    - **`FileManager`**: Saves snippets to files and manages directories.
    - **`MetadataManager`**: Saves metadata about the snippets to MongoDB.
- **Interactions**:
    - **`MongoDBWatcher`** -> **`CodeSnippetExtractor`** -> **`FileManager`**
    - **`FileManager`** -> **`MetadataManager`**

### **Step 4: Create Physical Architecture**

- Implement classes for each logical component.
- Set up MongoDB collections and file storage infrastructure.

### **Step 5: Detail Component Design**

- Design **`MongoDBWatcher`** with methods to handle change streams.
- Implement **`CodeSnippetExtractor`** with logic to identify and extract code blocks.
- Develop **`FileManager`** to create directories and save files.
- Implement **`MetadataManager`** to record file metadata.

### **Step 6: Validate and Verify**

- Test the overall system by simulating new entries in MongoDB.
- Validate that snippets are extracted and saved correctly.
- Verify that metadata is recorded accurately in the database.
