# Design Guidance

This document provides guidance on designing and structuring your application to effectively integrate with Notion databases using Pydantic models. By following these best practices, you can ensure that your application is well-organized, maintainable, and scalable.

## Property Managment

### Automated Property Validation and Syncing

Create a mechanism in your controller class that checks for consistency between the properties defined in your Pydantic models and the properties in the Notion database:

**At Startup**: On initialization of your controller, validate that every field in your Pydantic model has a corresponding property in the Notion database. If properties are missing, the system could either log a warning, throw an error, or automatically create the necessary properties in the Notion database.

**During Development**: Provide developers with tools or scripts that can validate or set up a Notion database according to the specifications of a Pydantic model. This can be part of your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that any changes in the data model are reflected in the database schema before deployment.

```python
def validate_or_create_notion_properties(self):
    notion_properties = self.get_notion_properties()
    pydantic_fields = {field: type_ for field, type_ in self.DataClass.__annotations__.items()}

    for field, field_type in pydantic_fields.items():
        if field not in notion_properties:
            self.create_notion_property(field, field_type)
        elif not self.is_compatible(notion_properties[field], field_type):
            raise ValueError(f"Type mismatch for field '{field}' in Notion database.")
```

### Use Pydantic Validators

Leverage Pydantic’s built-in validation system to ensure that data conforms to both the Pydantic model and the Notion database schema. Custom validators can be written to check that data intended for the database meets all requirements or constraints defined by the Notion API.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class MyDataModel(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

    @validator('name')
    def name_must_be_string(cls, value):
        assert isinstance(value, str), 'name must be a string'
        return value

    @validator('age')
    def age_must_be_positive(cls, value):
        assert value > 0, 'age must be positive'
        return value
```

### Dynamic Property Handling

For applications that need a high degree of flexibility, you can design your system to dynamically handle data fields not present in the Pydantic model or the Notion database. This can be managed by:

Storing extra fields in a JSON or text field in Notion.
Using a flexible Pydantic model with a dict field that can hold any additional properties not explicitly defined in the model.

### Property Mapping

If the names of the properties in Notion cannot be directly matched with your Pydantic model’s fields (due to naming conventions or limitations), maintain a mapping dictionary within your controller to translate Pydantic fields to Notion property names.

```python
property_mapping = {
    'pydantic_field_name': 'NotionPropertyName',
    # More mappings...
}

def translate_to_notion_model(self, pydantic_model):
    notion_data = {self.property_mapping[key]: value for key, value in pydantic_model.dict().items() if key in self.property_mapping}
    return notion_data
```

### Documentation and Schema Management

Maintain thorough documentation of the database schema and ensure it is easily accessible and up-to-date. This can include:

A version-controlled document or a section in your repository that outlines the current database schema and its mapping to the Pydantic models.

Regular reviews and audits of the schema to ensure it matches the actual data usage patterns and application requirements.
These strategies will help you ensure that your application can robustly handle interactions with Notion databases while maintaining the integrity and consistency of your data.
