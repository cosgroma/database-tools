# Copilot Instructions

This document provides instructions for developers to implement additional features and improvements to the Copilot application.


1. Extend MongoDBWatcher class to handle updates:
    - Add a method to handle update operations in the watched collection.
    - Ensure that the method can update the relevant metadata in the `files` collection.

2. Implement a method to clean up old files:
    - Add a method to remove files older than a specified age from the filesystem.
    - Ensure that the corresponding metadata is also removed from the `files` collection.

3. Add a method to archive processed results:
    - Implement a method to move processed results to an archive collection after a certain period.
    - Ensure that the archived results are stored with all relevant metadata and can be queried if needed.

4. Add logging functionality:
    - Integrate logging to record the processing steps and any errors encountered.
    - Ensure that logs include timestamps and detailed messages for debugging.

5. Improve code snippet extraction:
    - Enhance the _extract_code_blocks method to handle different code block formats.
    - Ensure that the method can accurately extract code snippets from various types of content.

6. Add support for processing multiple languages:
    - Modify the save_snippets_to_files method to detect the programming language of each snippet.
    - Save each snippet with the appropriate file extension based on the detected language.

7. Implement a user interface for monitoring:
    - Create a simple web interface to display the status of the watcher and processed results.
    - Allow users to query and view file metadata and processed results through the interface.
