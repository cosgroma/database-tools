# Requirements

## **Project Overview**

This project involves creating an application to watch for changes in a MongoDB collection and process those changes by extracting code snippets, saving them as files, and recording the processed results into a separate MongoDB collection. The app should be able to handle new entries, register additional features for processing, and manage the metadata of files.

## **Critical Requirements**

1. **MongoDB Change Stream Integration**:
    - The app must use MongoDB Change Streams to watch for changes in a specified collection.
    - The app should handle **`insert`** operations and process the new documents accordingly.
2. **File Management**:
    - Extract code snippets from the conversation messages.
    - Save code snippets as files in a directory named based on a sluggified title of the conversation.
    - Store file metadata in a **`files`** collection in MongoDB, including conversation ID, title, file path, snippet content, and processed time.
3. **Metadata Storage**:
    - Save processed results and file metadata in separate collections for further analysis and refinement.
    - Ensure that the stored metadata includes all relevant properties for querying and managing the files.
4. **Feature Registration**:
    - Allow for registering additional processing features that can be triggered by new entries in the watched collection.
    - Ensure that these features can be easily extended and integrated into the processing pipeline.

## **Critical Functions**

1. **MongoDBWatcher Class**:
    - Initialize the MongoDB client and set up the required collections.
    - Register handlers for processing new entries.
    - Watch the specified collection for changes using Change Streams.
2. **Extract and Save Code Snippets**:
    - Extract code snippets from the content of conversation messages.
    - Save the extracted snippets as files in a structured directory.
    - Record metadata about the saved files in the **`files`** collection.
3. **Save Processed Results**:
    - Save metadata about the processed conversations in a separate collection for further refinement.
    - Ensure that all relevant properties are stored and can be queried efficiently.
4. **Query and Manage Files**:
    - Implement functions to query the **`files`** collection based on conversation ID, project, or other criteria.
    - Provide a structured way to manage and analyze the processed data.

## **Non-Critical Requirements**

1. **Logging and Error Handling**:
    - Implement logging to track the processing steps and errors.
    - Ensure that errors are handled gracefully and logged for further analysis.
    - Use a structured logging library to manage logs effectively.
    - Include detailed error messages and stack traces for debugging.
2. **Archiving and Cleanup**:
   - Implement a method to archive processed results after a certain period.
   - Add a cleanup function to remove old files and corresponding metadata from the system.
   - Ensure that the archiving and cleanup processes are efficient and do not impact the performance of the system.
   - Provide options to configure the archiving and cleanup policies based on the project requirements.
3. **User Interface for Monitoring**:
    - Create a simple web interface to display the status of the watcher and processed results.
    - Allow users to query and view file metadata and processed results through the interface.
    - Ensure that the interface is responsive and user-friendly.

## **Future Enhancements**

1. **Advanced Code Snippet Analysis**:
    - Implement syntax highlighting in saved files.
    - Use machine learning models to classify code snippets by programming language or functionality.
2. **Automated Documentation Generation**:
    - Generate markdown documentation for each conversation or project, summarizing the extracted code snippets and their context.
    - Include links to the original conversation and related files.
3. **Real-time Notifications**:
    - Integrate with messaging platforms (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) to send notifications when new snippets are processed.
    - Allow users to subscribe to specific projects or keywords.
4. **Tagging and Categorization**:
    - Implement automatic tagging of snippets based on their content.
    - Allow users to manually add tags and categories for better organization.
5. **Version Control Integration**:
    - Automatically commit saved snippets to a Git repository.
    - Track changes to snippets over time and support diffs.
6. **Search and Filtering**:
    - Implement a search functionality to find snippets based on keywords, tags, or code content.
    - Provide filters for date ranges, projects, and languages.
7. **Metrics and Analytics**:
    - Generate usage statistics and analytics, such as the number of snippets processed per day or most common programming languages.
    - Visualize this data through charts and dashboards.
8. **Security and Access Control**:
    - Implement user authentication and authorization to control access to the app and its data.
    - Ensure secure storage and transmission of sensitive data.
9. **Export and Import Features**:
    - Allow users to export snippets and their metadata in various formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).
    - Support importing existing snippets and metadata into the system.
10. **Integration with Development Tools**:
    - Integrate with popular development environments (e.g., VSCode, JetBrains) to provide in-editor access to snippets.
    - Support direct copying of snippets into the code editor.
11. **Code Quality Checks**:
    - Implement automated code quality checks and linting for extracted snippets.
    - Provide feedback on potential improvements or issues in the code.
12. **Collaboration Features**:
    - Allow multiple users to collaborate on projects, adding comments and annotations to snippets.
    - Implement a review process for approving or rejecting snippets.
13. **Backup and Restore**:
    - Implement automated backup of the database and files.
    - Provide options for restoring from backups in case of data loss.
14. **Enhanced Logging and Monitoring**:
    - Implement detailed logging of all processing steps and actions.
    - Provide a monitoring dashboard to track the health and performance of the app.
15. **Customization and Extensibility**:
    - Allow users to customize processing rules and handlers through a configuration interface.
    - Support plugins or extensions to add new functionalities easily.
